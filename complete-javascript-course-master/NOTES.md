### Highlevel

Developer does not have to worry about managing resources manually. The Programming language does it
through abstractions.

### Garbage-collected

An algorithm on javascript engine removes all unused objects from the computer memory

### Interpreted or just-in-time compiled

Computer only understands zeros and ones, so programming languages are
abstractions for the commands computers understands. This process is called compiling. Javascript does that on
time of execution, unlike Java, for instance.

### Multi-paradigm

Paradigm is an approach and mindset of structuring code which will direct your coding style
and technique. Paradigms can be classified as Imperative or Declarative. You can adopt any of these paradigms using javascipt:

    **Procedural programming** (organize code in a linear way, with functions in between)
    **Object-Oriented programing (OOP)**
    **Functional Programming (FP)**

### Prototype-based object-oriented

### First-class functions

functions are simply treated as variables. we can pass them into other functions and
return them from functions

### Dymamic typed language

### Single threaded

**Concurrency model** is how the Javascript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.
JavaScript runs in one single thread, so it can do one thing at a time.

### Non-blocking event loop

By using an **event loop**, Javascript takes long running tasks, executes them in the "background" and puts them back
in the main thread once they are finished
