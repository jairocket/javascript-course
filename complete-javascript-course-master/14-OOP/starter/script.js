/*

Object-Oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. In this context, paradigm means 
style of code, how we write and organize code

We use objects to model (describe) real-world (E.g. todo list item or user) or abstract features, such as HTML components
or data structure

Objects may contain data (properties) and code (methods). By using objects, we pack data and corresponding behaviour 
into the block

In OOP, objects are self contained pieces/blocks of code that work as building blocks of applications and interact 
interact with one another

Interactions happen through a public interface (API): methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to
communicate with the object

OOP's goal is organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid spaghetti code)

/*
Classes are like blueprints from with we can create new objects

Instances are the objects created from a class

The 4 fundamental OOP principles are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism
